<div class="section section--first intro">
    <p class="blurb">Hello, I'm Matt, a UX/UI designer specialising accessibility. I enjoy making websites and apps easy for people to use.</p>

    <h2 class="section__heading">Skills</h2>
    <p style="margin-bottom:3rem;max-width:70ch;">I hold a bachelor's degree in Design &amp; Innovation but my web design and development skills are mostly self-taught. I lean towards the designer end of the designer-developer scale but I try to keep my technical knowledge reasonably up-to-date. There's always more to learn! I'm particularly interested in accessibility and inclusive design.</p>
