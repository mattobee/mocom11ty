    <h2>Passionate about accessibility</h2>
    <p>I'm passionate about accessibility and inclusive design because I know that software has the power to create opportunities and improve lives. As a child of disabled parents, I've seen the effects of good and bad design firsthand. Bad design stops people buying their own groceries and managing their own finances, excludes them from conversations, and makes it difficult to find a job. Good design removes barriers, creates opportunities, and makes things better for everyone.</p>
