    <h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Matt</h1>
</div>

<div class="container readable">
    <p>I'm a senior digital product designer with a focus on accessibility and inclusive design. I enjoy the challenge of solving complex problems with design thinking.</p>
    <p>Over the last 16 years, I've worked on projects of all shapes and sizes for a wide range of clients across a broad spectrum of industries.</p>
    <p>I'm currently a Principal Designer at NearForm, where I lead design work on projects for innovative startups, familiar brands, and government agencies around the world.</p>
    <h2>Short Biography</h2>
    <p>Talking about myself in the third person so you don't have to.</p>

    <h2>Why accessibility?</h2>
    <p>I'm passionate about accessibility and inclusive design in part because I grew up with disabled parents. I saw what things they struggled with and missed out on, and I learned how even simple changes can make a big difference. Those lessons stayed with me and helped shape my career. I do what I can to make the products I work on more accessible and try to inspire other people along the way.</p>
    <h2>My design process</h2>
    <p>I wouldn't say that I have one design process so much as a collection of strategies and techniques that I mix and match in whatever way makes sense for each project. I'm often embedded in a client team so I have to adapt to their preferred ways of working.</p>
    <p>Broadly speaking I like to:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
        <li>Work in the open</li>
        <li>Learn from the experts</li>
        <li>Collaborate with engineers</li>
        <li>Get feedback from users early and often</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>My tools</h2>
    <h3>Productivity</h3>
    <ul class="bullet">
        <li>I do most of my work on a Macbook Pro. <a href="https://rectangleapp.com/">Rectangle</a> keeps my windows organised and <a href="https://maccy.app/">Maccy</a> manages my clipboard history, both open source.</li>
        <li>Email is still a thing but I tend to keep in touch with colleagues and clients over <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> and <a href="https://zoom.com">Zoom</a>. Some clients prefer Microsoft Teams.</li>
        <li>Most big projects are managed in <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a> but <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a> works well for smaller projects. <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a> tells me what I personally need to do every day. I have tried other to-do apps but Todoist seems to be the best value cross-platform solution.</li>
        <li>I'm a big fan of <a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a> and its relational databases. I have tried scribbling notes on my iPad in <a href="https://www.goodnotes.com/">Goodnotes</a> but typing notes just comes more naturally to me.</li>
        <li>I have been using <a href="https://reclaim.ai/r/s/nd5hj">Reclaim</a> to manage my calendar recently. It talks to Todoist and Google Calendar, blocking out time in my calendar for important tasks and making sure I have space to walk the dog and take a lunch break. It even updates my Slack status so that people know what I'm doing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Design</h3>
    <ul class="bullet">
        <li><a href="https://figma.com">Figma</a> is my design tool of choice but I still reluctantly use <a href="https://sketch.com">Sketch</a> for some projects. I rarely open Photoshop or Illustrator. I wonder what the Adobe takover will mean for Figma in the long term? <a href="https://penpot.app/">Penpot</a> is a promising open source alternative.</li>
        <li>I sometimes use <a href="https://invisionapp.com">InVision</a> and <a href="https://zeplin.com">Zeplin</a> for sharing prototypes and developer handover but Figma does the same things well enough for most projects. I try to avoid having lots of separate tools.</li>
        <li>I prefer <a href="https://miro.com">Miro</a> over <a href="https://mural.co/">Mural</a> for workshops. <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">Figjam</a> is a nice lightweight alternative to both, with the added bonus of plugins and widgets.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Code</h3>
    <ul class="bullet">
        <li>I don't touch code much during my day job. When I do, I reach for <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> but I have used <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a> and <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> in the past.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a> is my static site generator of choice but I have played with <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> too. A few years ago I would have used <a href="https://expressionengine.com">ExpressionEngine</a>, <a href="https://craftcms.com">Craft</a>, or <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>.</li>
        <li>I push my code to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> using the <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop app</a>. I tend to use <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a> for hosting (because it's free and works beautifully) but <a href="https://34sp.com">34SP</a> is my host of choice for anything non-static.</li>
    </ul>
