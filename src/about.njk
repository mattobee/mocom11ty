    <h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Matt</h1>
</div>

<div class="container readable">
    <p>I'm a senior digital product designer with a focus on accessibility and inclusive design. I enjoy the challenge of solving complex problems with design thinking.</p>
    <p>Over the last 16 years, I've worked on projects of all shapes and sizes for a wide range of clients across a broad spectrum of industries.</p>
    <p>I'm currently a Principal Designer at NearForm, where I lead design work on projects for innovative startups, familiar brands, and government agencies around the world. I'm also an Open University postgraduate software engineering student.</p>
    <h2>Short Biography</h2>
    <p>Talking about myself in the third person so you don't have to.</p>

    <h2>Why accessibility?</h2>
    <p>I'm passionate about accessibility and inclusive design in part because I grew up with disabled parents. I saw what things they struggled with and missed out on, and I learned how even simple changes can make a big difference. Those lessons stayed with me and helped shape my career. I do what I can to make the products I work on more accessible and try to inspire other people along the way.</p>
    <h2>My design process</h2>
    <p>I wouldn't say that I have one design process so much as a collection of strategies and techniques that I mix and match in whatever way makes sense for each project. I'm often embedded in a client team so I have to adapt to their preferred ways of working.</p>
    <p>Broadly speaking I like to:</p>
    <ul class="bullet">
        <li>Work in the open</li>
        <li>Learn from the experts</li>
        <li>Collaborate with engineers</li>
        <li>Get feedback from users early and often</li>
    </ul>
